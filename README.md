# radio_rtl_sdr
experiments with radio signal modulation and decoding

## radio.py
is a script to play radio in real time using a rtl sdr stick

## modulation.ipynb
describes the most important modulation types (amplitude,phase,frequency,qam) and has simple implementations to decode them

## decode_radio.py
has step by step plots how the radio decoding can be done

## decode_gsm.py
trying to decode gsm mobile signals. work in progress!
